                            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard (optional)</li>
                            <li>1 large egg (free-range)</li>
                            <li>1 round lettuce</li>
                            <li>1 beef tomato</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Using a bowl, mix the minced beef and mustard.</li>
                            <li>Crack the egg into the bowl, then add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.</li>
                            <li>With clean hands, scrunch and mix everything up well. Divide into 6 and pat and mould each piece into a roundish shape, roughly 2cm thick.</li>
                            <li>Place the burgers onto a plate, drizzle with oil, then cover and place in the fridge until needed â€“ this will help to firm them up.</li>
                            <li>To cook the burgers, preheat a large griddle or frying pan for 4 minutes on a high heat, then turn the heat down to medium.</li>
